Open weather 5 day forecast iphone app


This app retrieves the 5 day forecast from Open Weather and displays it in a table view.
It also shows the current conditions.

It uses a few cocoa pods: AFNetworking, RestKit, SOCKit, etc. mainly for retrieving/parsing json into model objects. 

UI as you might notice is similar to Yahoo weather app but adapted to present the 5 day forecast data instead.

# How to use #
Open in Xcode, pick an iphone simulator and hit the run button.
